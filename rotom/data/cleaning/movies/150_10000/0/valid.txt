COL Description VAL Based on the Stephen King novel, Misery casts James Caan as romance writer Paul Sheldon. After a car accident, Sheldon is trapped in his vehicle in the middle of a blizzard; on the brink of death, he is rescued by Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), a former nurse who carries the writer to her home to recover. It turns out that Annie is a huge fan of Sheldon's work, which consists of a series of romance novels about a character named Misery Chastain; Paul, wanting to explore more serious work, has,decided to kill Misery in order to write a raw, autobiographical book about life on the streets. Annie, who has lived almost vicariously through the Misery Chastain books for years, is livid over the harsh language of Paul's book, but becomes almost crazed upon discovering Misery's fate. To teach the bedridden man a lesson, she forces him to burn the autobiographical manuscript and resurrect Misery; after learning of Annie's murderous past, he knows that Misery's return to life will mark the end of his own.	1

COL Description VAL This New York-made independent film, the auspicious debut of talented filmmaker Abel Ferrara, who also starred in the film and wrote most of its songs under the moniker 'Jimmy Laine,' offers many genuinely disturbing, graphic shocks as it tells the story of a Big Apple artist living on the edge of the city's fringe. Motivated by his abiding terror of ending up a homeless, drunken vagrant like his father, and suffering from terrifying hallucinations, he is driven to begin murdering homeless,hoboes with a power drill. Eventually his compulsion takes a paranoid twist and he begins murdering anyone who wronged him in the past.	1
