COL Description VAL Romance in the '80s provides the underlying theme of this off-beat comedy-drama about the tangled interrelationships between an emotionally unstable, insecure bar owner who is irresistibly attractive to men, a neurotic Seattle radio psychologist who bills herself as 'Dr. Love' but has little hands on experience with love, and a fast-talking, womanizing genius with a pathological tendency to lie.	1

COL Description VAL Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 picks up where Sony Pictures Animation's hit comedy left off. Inventor Flint Lockwood's genius is finally being recognized as he's invited by his idol Chester V to join The Live Corp Company, where the best and brightest inventors in the world create technologies for the betterment of mankind. Chester's right-hand-gal - and one of his greatest inventions - is Barb (a highly evolved orangutan with a human brain, who is also devious, manipulative and likes to,wear lipstick). It's always been Flint's dream to be recognized as a great inventor, but everything changes when he discovers that his most infamous machine (which turns water into food) is still operating and is now creating food-animal hybrids - 'foodimals!' With the fate of humanity in his hands, Chester sends Flint and his friends on a dangerously delicious mission, battling hungry tacodiles, shrimpanzees, apple pie-thons, double bacon cheespiders and other food creatures to save the world again!	1
