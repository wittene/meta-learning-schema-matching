all mood and no movie .		1
the master of disguise represents adam sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .		1
there 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups .		1

although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film does n't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything .		1
though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .		1

near the end takes on a whole other meaning .		2

this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder .		2
clever but not especially compelling .		2
impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act .		2
a puzzling experience .		2

you may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject .		3
-lrb- clooney 's -rrb- debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh .		3
a bright , inventive , thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy .		3
close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash-cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air .		3
confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris ' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture .		3
robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show .		3
translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be ya-ya .		3

it is ok for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged .		3
moonlight mile does n't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy .		3

it 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid .		0
a humorless journey into a philosophical void .		0
the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .		0
an awful lot like one of -lrb- spears ' -rrb- music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .		0
a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .		0
the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .		0

skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd .		0
devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special .		0
the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected .		0
