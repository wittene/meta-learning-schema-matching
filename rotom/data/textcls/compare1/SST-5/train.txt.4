it 's worth taking the kids to .		4
a delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie .		4

despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela .		1
ver wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless .		1
feels familiar and tired .		1
snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this .		1
does n't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films .		1
sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -lrb- ahola -rrb- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation .		1
blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` pretty woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .		1

the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .		1
plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood .		1
this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship .		1

but it 's also disappointing to a certain degree .		1
... pray does n't have a passion for the material .		1
too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley 's least accessible screed yet .		1
for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression .		1
... watching it was painful .		1
has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release .		1
this is not an easy film .		1
it is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished .		1
a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep ` epic . '		1
gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .		1
a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground .		1
everything about girls ca n't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way .		1
any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .		1
the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .		1
the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -lrb- and no one -rrb- .		1
nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .		1

the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there .		2
once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .		2
charming and funny -lrb- but ultimately silly -rrb- movie .		2
it 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` the loud and the ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .		2
an original little film about one young woman 's education .		2
a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor .		2
a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .		2
comedy troupe broken lizard 's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot .		2
a meatballs for the bare-midriff generation .		2
... only bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction .		2

what 's left is a rich stew of longing .		2
every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked .		2
this is n't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work .		2
ana 's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery , as she 's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her rubenesque physique ...		2

only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it 's looking for .		2
the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film .		2

really dumb but occasionally really funny .		2
i 'm happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version , but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes .		2
harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden .		2
best described as i know what you did last winter .		2

... little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen .		2
just plain silly .		2

with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , the spy kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids .		3
nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book .		3
the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai 's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her .		3
it makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film .		3
a quiet , disquieting triumph .		3
a vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish .		3
the moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended .		3
although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey		3
it 's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart .		3
as the princess , sorvino glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat .		3
you walk out of the good girl with mixed emotions -- disapproval of justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions .		3
beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom .		3
the pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies .		3
... a solid , unassuming drama .		3
while somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you 've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out .		3

your children will be occupied for 72 minutes .		3
it made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters .		3
it is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events .		3
yes , it 's as good as you remember .		3
in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel 's closely watched trains and danis tanovic 's no man 's land .		3
the charm of revolution os is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers .		3
this movie got me grinning .		3
formuliac , but fun .		3
so fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated .		3

generic thriller junk .		0
what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .		0
it 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .		0
philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .		0
in the end , there is n't much to it .		0
the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance .		0
gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .		0

a thoroughly awful movie -- dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of ` the thing ' and a geriatric ` scream . '		0
the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos had n't blown them all up .		0
